<h1>Covid-ChatBot </h1>
<p>A chatbot that provides COVID-19 resources to UCSC students. Utilizes a shallow neural network to classify user intents and provides either templated responses when applicable or a dynamic response generated from a finetuned GPT-2 model.</p>
<p>Templated responses are responses to generic questions or questions which have a pre-defined answer. Dynamic responses are classified as responses which need to be developed from various sources by picking out the right information from the databank and providing a human-like response to a question that does not have a pre-defined response. Questions related to symptoms of the disease or advice on whether to visit the doctor or not falls under this category.</p>
