doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.\\nDoctor:\\n, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.\\nDoes your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nI have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.\\nDoctor:\\nHi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.\\n\\n',\n"," 'Patient:\\n doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?\\nDoctor:\\n, \\nIn my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nAfter doing all these I can upload all for further query.\\nDoctor:\\nHi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nAs per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.\\nDoctor:\\nHi,  I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).\\nYour total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.\\nI hope this helps.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nHow many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?\\nDoctor:\\nHi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.\\n\\n',\n"," 'Patient:\\n doctor,\\nI am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus.\\nSecond, I have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. I always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. I also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. I did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive Covid. And I quit smoking past week. Down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. Why am I feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? How likely am I to have Covid-19? And how likely am I to die from it?\\nDoctor:\\n. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.\\nPlease continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water.\\n\\n',\n"," \"Patient:\\n doctor,\\nLast night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.\\nI took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.\\nRight now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.\\nI am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.\\nDoctor:\\n,\\nplease answer the following:\\nAny travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nI travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.\\nDuring sleep, I do not have much aches. Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.\\nDoctor:\\nHi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?\\nCan you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better.\\nAvoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.\\nYou need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised.\\nLastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient?\\nCan you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nI woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.\\nSo far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.\\nI will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot.\\nI will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep.\\nI stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.\\nSo, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help?\\nDoctor:\\nHi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.\\nI heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus.\\nYes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils).\\nThe tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection.\\nNow you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not Corona). They usually get better with time and supportive treatment. Traditional Indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. Tea makes a good addition I guess. Sudafed and Zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. Tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully.\\nNow watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. In such cases promptly revert to me. You may need a Z pack then.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nAs of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.\\nHere is my story: Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.\\nFriday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better.\\nSaturday February 29th - diarrhea\\nSunday March 1st - diarrhea\\nMonday March 2 - diarrhea\\nTuesday March 3 - diarrhea\\nWednesday March 4 - No stool\\nThursday March 3 - No more diarrhea\\nFriday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issues\\nMonday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.\\nSunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat\\nAfternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine.\\nOn Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac?\\nI said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes.\\nTuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.\\nWednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.\\nThursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.\\nFriday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.\\n15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.\\n11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.\\n11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.\\n11:58 AM - feeling a bit better\\n12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.\\nAfter an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.\\nDoctor:\\n, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nI went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine.\\nRight now I tried Pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes I think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, I tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. Then I think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. Even water makes my heart beat a little faster. Should I stick with Pepcid? Finish the entire bottle? I think it has 20-30 pieces.\\nI used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like I get hungry before I go to bed then I started eating snacks and lying down. Sometimes I starve myself. Sometimes I wake up with acid feeling in my mouth.\\nI don't know why I woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like I had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). I then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, I started to breathe better again.\\nCould it be shortness or breath? May be blood pressure? Esophagus issue? Chest issue? Heart issue? I am having weird breathing. Should I be worried?\\nDoctor:\\nHi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor,\\nI was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.\\nDoctor:\\nHi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats.\\nPatient:\\nThank you doctor, \\nI really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.\\nDoctor:\\nHi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?\\nPatient:\\nYeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!\\nI try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...\\nExercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely.\\nSince high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.\\nOne doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.\\nSo, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.\\nDoctor:\\nI guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.\\nRestart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.\\nPatient:\\nSounds good! Awesome! Appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot.

Non productive cough but lungs feel heavy and full. Could this be pneumonia I have developed? I have at it before. I must tell you that I do have asthma. Thank you!\\nDoctor:\\n,In my opinion, you should definitely consult a pulmonologist. There are two main possibilities for your symptoms. 1. Lung infection (pneumonia).2. Worsening of asthma.So you will need a chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma.

So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS). Also get done chest x ray for pneumonia. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia.

Pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm. So in my opinion, you should ask your doctor about starting inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or salmeterol to relieve bronchospasm. Also avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report.

I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.\\nDoctor:\\n welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

We know that high temperature kills most pathogens eg protozoa, viruses and bacteria. That's why cooking is recommending for certain foods rather than eating it 'raw'. Temperatures of 140 to 160 degree F kills most pathogens including viruses.

We are currently quarantining him. What next for him? Is it likely that he will get it again?\n","Doctor:\n","   Very unlikely   Any contact with a deoiderongerone with known COVID-19 infection will mean very little, if at all, short of week only treatment period for 2-3 weeks.   Any contact with a deoiderongerone with known exposure to people who have visited the area will also likely mean very little, if very little. If at all possible, going for symptomatic treatment will do little to change the course. Even a mild cough can progress to symptomatic buff, so repeat chest x ray is needed after 4 weeks.           \n","\n","\n","Patient:\n","My daughter is 2 years old. After an episode of pneumonia did a follow up chest xray with some tests in there. I still have a bad cough and a couple of strands of hair in my throat. What should I Do?\n","Doctor:\n","   May call Dr or visit ER   Most cases of COVID-19 are associated with cough, though milder cases are possible.   You should consult a dr on this and if it is bothersome, seek medical advice. Avoid Ibuprofen/other NSAIDs, alcohol, and acetaminophen. For milder cases, consult pediatric pulmonologist.For most patients, shortness of breath and/or absence of fever are not significant symptoms.If, however,ingrown or other mild symptoms (e.g. sore throat, no cough)  are not suggestive of infection, evaluate case Report.For severe pneumonia, respond by clear X-ray and/or supply needed treatment.          \n","\n","\n","Patient:\n","What can I use against coronavirus if I run out of hand sanitizer?\n","Doctor:\n","   Water and soap   It is best, providing available easily.

Where do all the germs go after using it, and will it actually protect me against COVID-19?\n","Doctor:\n","It actually works. As does washing your hands with soap and water. All the germs die after using it, so they become harmless. Sanitizer and washing your hands will help protect you, but you can still catch COVID-19 through your mouth and nose and inhaled into the lungs. Social distance and quarantine as needed.\n","\n","\n","Patient:\n","Should someone with a compromised immune system due to rheumatoid arthritis get the flu vaccine, especially during the COVID-19 crisis? Also, does the flu vaccine in South Africa use live or dead viruses?\n","Doctor:\n","   Flu vaccine   Any flu vaccine will cause your immune system to respond.  I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary.           \n","\n","\n","Patient:\n","My wife just found out that she sat next to someone on Tuesday who is being tested for the Coronavirus.

However, in my opinion, the current NICD and MAHD are in need of a re-evaluation. Any and all medications can be tried with antibiotics, usually cefuruxime or zantac.   There are, however, some rare symptoms which can be directly associated with resistance to COVID-19, such as tightness in chest, rapid breathing or respiratory symptoms.

So chest pain is commonly seen with pneumonia and anti-inflammatory painkiller drugs like paracetamol or ibuprofen should be tried. You can also apply warm water pad on affected areas of the chest. Once your pneumonia is cured, your pain will definitely subside. Mucinex is a good drug for pneumonia. It actually dilutes the secretions and made them easy to cough out. So continue with Mucinex.

Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.\n","\n","Patient:\n","\n","Hi- I was diagnosed a month ago with community pneumonia.

Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.\n","\n","Doctor:\n","\n","Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.\n","\n","Patient:\n","\n","How can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or pertusses in adults. How do you compare? My doc thinks I have pertusses. But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had PB pneumonia.

I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe?

Diagnosis of Pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks.  In which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *Culture of bacterium Bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *PCR test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions.
